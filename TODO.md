- find out all units and conversion from metwatch.cfg and match units in amalthea/config/lookup.yml:metwatch and config/bufr\_translation_??.yml
- outcomment all unneeded, experimental params lik WDIRmax
- fixed durations for params like CB, PRMSL, RCDC (extra column or define 1s, 1min as fixed?)
- reduce obs (highest scale -> highest priority source -> latest COR)
- implement -N flag (skip nulls, default off) --> explicitly save 'NULL'
- implement -w WARNING flag (define warning level or filter instead of just on/off switch)
- implement -p PROFILER flag (with fixed profiler or customizable - which would be harder)
- check / define all UNITS and store them in some table / yaml file
- develop true multiprocessing for 'decode\_bufr.py' (using multiprocessing and shelves)
